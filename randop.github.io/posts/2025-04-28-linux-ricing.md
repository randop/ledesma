I still remember back in 2009 where I'm at the office on my former workplace installing [Compiz Fusion](https://www.compiz-fusion.org/) on my Fedora Linux workstation. It was really fun tweaking desktop. There is different kind of satisfaction to Linux ricing that Windows or Mac does not provide to this date.

Fast forward now in 2025, a popular youtuber have posted a viral video of Linux ricing experience.

I got inspired to try setting up [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) + [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) + [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) + [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

Will post it here on my blog.
