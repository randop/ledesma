[Eleventy (11ty)](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) is a simpler static site generator.
The old blog site is using Jekyll and I have now migrated to 11ty.

See the source code at [https://github.com/randop/ledesma/tree/master/randop.github.io](https://github.com/randop/ledesma/tree/master/randop.github.io)

It is easier and very familiar to work with, thanks to javascript.

Be back for content as I import more of my archives.
